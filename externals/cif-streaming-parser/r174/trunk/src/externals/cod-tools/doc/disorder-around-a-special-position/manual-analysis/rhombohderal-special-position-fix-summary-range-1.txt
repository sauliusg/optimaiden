From non-polymer to polymer:
1552287 Old CIF: contains an incomplete molecule.
        New CIF: contains a polymer.
1552288 Old CIF: contains an incomplete molecule.
        New CIF: contains a polymer.
1515272 Old CIF: seems OK, non-polymer.
        New CIF: contains an incorrect polymer. This seems to arrise from an incorrect handling of a solvent that is disordered around a special position (moeity contains atoms C170, ..., C174, Cl10).
1549195 Old CIF: seems OK, non-polymer.
        New CIF: is incorrectly recognised as a polymer.
1549501 Old CIF: contains an incomplete molecule.
        New CIF: is incorrectly recognised as a polymer.

Strange:
1100732 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains extra atoms of a CH3OH solvent that is disordered around a special position.
1502786 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: extra moieties get generated and some of the solvent moieties get incorrectly stick together. The solvent moieties in question seem to be disordered around a special position.
1100733 Old CIF seems OK.
        New CIF contains extra atoms of a CH3OH solvent that is disordered around a special position.
1503542 Old CIF: was stoichiometrically correct, but not chemically sound.
        New CIF: seems to contain extra S and H atoms. The problem may stem from the fact that H atoms are not properly marked as disordered around a special position.
1504205 Old CIF: seems stoichiometrically correct.
        New CIF: incorrectly contains a ring consisting of water oxygen atoms. The issue might also be related to the fact that atoms O1W and O2W are marked as being disordered around a special position, however, as part of different assemblies.
1507726 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains O2 moeity instead of the O atom. The moiety involves a O1 atom which is marked as disordered around a special position.
1508293 Old CIF: contain solvent molecules disordered in as strange way. Probably a problem of the original CIF.
        New CIF: contain solvent molecules disordered in as strange way. Probably a problem of the original CIF.
1513296 Old CIF: contain solvent molecules disordered in as strange way. Probably a problem of the original CIF.
        New CIF: contain solvent molecules disordered in as strange way. Probably a problem of the original CIF.
1514209 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains extra atoms of a solvent molecule that is disordered around a special position (i.e. O1N atom).
1514556 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains extra moieties. Also, disorder around a special position of the C1U, ..., C6U atoms seems to be handled incorrectly.
1517271 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains extra moieties. Also, disorder around a special position of the O3Z, ..., C4Z atoms seems to be handled incorrectly.
1517276 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains water moieties that are incorrectly disordered around a special position.
1519002 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains twice as many atoms and incorrect handling of disorder around a special position.

        New CIF: contains more strange disordered atoms.
1520572 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains twice as many atoms and has incorrect handling of disorder around a special position.
1520631 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains incorrect handling of disorder around a special position.
1529316 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: contains incorrect handling of disorder around a special position (H atoms).
1540405 Old CIF: contains NO2 moieties instead of NO3
        New CIF: contains incorrect handling of disorder around a special position (N11 atom).
1542406 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: disorder of hydrogen atoms results in bumps.

        New CIF: disorder of water atoms results in bumps.
1543341 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: disorder of hydrogen atoms results in bumps.

        New CIF: disorder of a CH3OH moeity results in bumps.
1546337 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: disorder of hydrogen atoms results in bumps.
1546952 Old CIF: is missing one F atom.
        New CIF: has extra F atoms (disorder around special position).
1546995 Old CIF: seems mostly OK.
        New CIF: disorder of a CH2Cl2 moeity results in bumps.
1547861 Old CIF: seems OK.
        New CIF: disorder of a solvent moeity results in bumps.

        New CIF: incorrect handling of disorder around a special position results in clashing ligands.
1552004 Old CIF: was incomplete.
        New CIF: bumps due to incorrect handling of disorder around a special position.
1552355 Old CIF: contains an insufficient number of hydrogen atoms.
