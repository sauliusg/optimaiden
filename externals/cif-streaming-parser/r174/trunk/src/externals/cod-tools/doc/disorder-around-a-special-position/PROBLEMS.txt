Problems still detected in special position disorder processing
===============================================================

1. When polymer parts are connected via loops that go outside the
   specified supercell (--max-polymer-span limits), the polymer
   trimmer removes those loops and the polymer representations become
   disconnected (this problem is seen in 7227613).

2. In the COD 7042409 structure, some benzene rings, including those
   that contain atoms disordered around a special position, come out
   distorted. It seems that disorder groups, including the "regular"
   disorder groups (i.e. those that are *not* disordered around a
   special position) are described incorrectly in the deposited COD
   file.
