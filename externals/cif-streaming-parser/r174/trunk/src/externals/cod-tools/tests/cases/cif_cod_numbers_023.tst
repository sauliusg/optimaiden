Test the way an entry with a related enantiomer entry is handled when the
related enantiomer entry is explicitly marked using a relevant COD data
item (i.e. _cod_related_enantiomer_entry.code,
_cod_related_enantiomer_entry_code, _cod_enantiomer_of).
Only the original entry should be recognised as a matching COD entry.
