Tests the way a dictionary import statement of a single save frame is handled
when a save frame with the same frame code already exists in the importing
file. The import statement uses the 'Full' import mode and the 'Replace' on
duplicate mode. The import operation should replace the save frame in
the dictionary with the imported save frame.
