Tests the way the order of validation dictionaries affects the validation results
due to the dictionary merging logic. Values from the 'ddl1_merge_base.dic'
dictionary should take precedence over values from the 'ddl1_merge_update.dic'
due to the dictionary order ['ddl1_merge_update.dic', 'ddl1_merge_base.dic'].
