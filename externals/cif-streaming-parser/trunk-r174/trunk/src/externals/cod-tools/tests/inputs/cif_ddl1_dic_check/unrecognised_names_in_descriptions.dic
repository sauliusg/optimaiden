_type                        null
_definition
;
 A category with a slightly incorrect human-readable definition. The definition
 contains references to non-existing data item names
 ( _test_item_with_no_existence ), as well as unrecognised categories
 like the TEST_CATEGORY_WITH_NO_EXISTENCE category.

 However, the definition also contains proper references like the one to the
 _test_data_names_in_descriptions_item data item or the
 TEST_DATA_NAMES_IN_DESCRIPTIONS (_test_data_names_in_descriptions_[])
 category.

 Some data names refer to items and categories in other dictionaries and as
 such are only considered correct when the appropriate dictionary is supplied.
 Consider the TEST_EXTERNAL_CATEGORY category and the
 _test_external_category_item item as an example.

_name                      '_test_data_names_in_descriptions_item'

_definition
;
 Unrecognised references include the ones to the _test_missing_item data item
 as well as the TEST_MISSING_ITEM category.

 Proper references include the ones to the _test_data_names_in_descriptions_item
 data item or the TEST_DATA_NAMES_IN_DESCRIPTIONS
 (_test_data_names_in_descriptions_[]) category.

 Data item names in incorrectly nested brackets should still be recognised,
 i.e., ({_test_data_names_in_descriptions_item}).

 Some data names refer to items and categories in other dictionaries and as
 such are only considered correct when the appropriate dictionary is supplied.
 Consider the TEST_EXTERNAL_CATEGORY category and the
 _test_external_category_item item as an example. 

 The newline symbol should also be properly treated as a word separator
 and not as part of the potential data name, i.e. _test_data_names_in_descriptions_item
should not be properly recognised.

data_test_CaSeD_data_names_in_descriptions_[]
_name                      '_test_CaSeD_data_names_in_descriptions_[]'
_category                    category_overview
_type                        null
_definition
;
 Referenced category that has a mixed case data block name and category name.

 Category names are recognised regardless of the capitalisation, i.e.,
 _test_CaSeD_data_names_in_descriptions_[],
 _TEST_CASED_DATA_NAMES_IN_DESCRIPTIONS_[],
 _TEST_CASED_DATA_NamES_IN_DESCRIPTIONS_[].
 Words in all capitals that contain underscores are also recognised as
 category names, i.e., TEST_CASED_DATA_NAMES_IN_DESCRIPTIONS.
;

data_test_CaSeD_data_names_in_descriptions_item
_name                      '_test_CaSeD_data_names_in_descriptions_item'
_category                    test_CaSeD_data_names_in_descriptions
_type                        char
_definition
;
 Referenced data item that has a mixed case data block name and data name.

 The capitalization of data item names should match the capitalisation,
 however, should match the one in the definition. For example, name
 _test_CaSeD_data_names_in_descriptions_item is correct while
 _test_cased_data_names_in_descriptions_item,
 _test_CASED_data_names_in_descriptions_item or
 _TEST_CASED_DATA_NAMES_IN_DESCRIPTIONS_ITEM should not.
